# Personal Portfolio at FreeCodeCamp

This project conceives a first version of my own personal portfolio,
inspired by the FreeCodeCamp certification project in the [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage).

## About

Simple personal portfolio that shows other certification projects for FCC in addition to some links to my LinkedIn, Github profiles and others

## Technologies

This version of the project was developed with React. The initial version was developed using HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript and is accessible in my [codepen profile](https://codepen.io/ArieldRio/pen/abbgvqx)

## Result

[Certificate granted by FCC for the Responsive Web Design course](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/ariel_del_rio/responsive-web-design)
